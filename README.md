# Backend for HW 4-5 blogging app

## What I did
- made a functional blog where you can
  - sign up
  - log in
  - create a post
  - edit your post
  - delete your post

## Extra credit:
- error messages appear in red
  - bad credentials on login
  - existing user on signup
  - passwords don't match on signup
  - fields not all filled in on login/signup
- user can only edit/delete own post
- nice styling
- "welcome" landing page with options upon signup
- simultaneous editing/Markdown display when editing a post
  - works for title, tags, AND content

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)
